Version 1.6.1 Beta (Feb 2, 2020)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**NEW FEATURES**


* 
  **Pre-configured Pipeline Library.** C-PAC can now be easily run with a growing selection of pre-configured pipelines with the --preconfig flag. See the updated `User Documentation <http://fcp-indi.github.io/>`_ for the pipelines available.

* 
  **Time Series De-spiking.** C-PAC can now run AFNI 3dDespike at the beginning of functional preprocessing, if enabled. https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dDespike.html

* 
  **Smooth to a Specific FWHM.** C-PAC can now run AFNI BlurToFWHM as an option, alongside the original FSL-based smoothing option. https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dBlurToFWHM.html

**IMPROVEMENTS**


* 
  **Temporal Filtering Configurability.** The order in which temporal filtering is performed in the pipeline can now be toggled either before or after nuisance regression. If set to before, nuisance regressors are also filtered.

* 
  **tCompCor Configurability.** Users can now choose polynomial regression of the time series, as well as configure the degree of brain mask erosion for tCompCor nuisance regression.

* 
  **BOLD Masking Configurability.** The FSL-BET option for BOLD masking now has full access to configurable parameters.

* 
  **CSF Regressor Configurability.** Ventricle mask refinement of CSF masks for CSF-based nuisance regression can now be toggled.

* 
  More informative messages for when someone provides an incorrect AWS S3 link for input data.

**FIXES**


* 
  Anatomical in template space QC images are now displayed properly in the QC Interface.

* 
  The 'scan' and 'selector' buttons now work properly again in the QC Interface.

* 
  Translation and rotation motion plots are now labeled correctly.

* 
  A bug where the input data configuration would be formatted incorrectly when no BIDS directory JSON was present has been fixed.

* 
  The "start_idx" pipeline field, which allows users to select the first time point in the time series, now works properly again.

* 
  Fixed an error that would report a duplicate node name when running a FNIRT-based pipeline and ICA-AROMA at the same time.

In addition, the C-PAC Docker and Singularity images, as well as the AWS AMI, have all been updated. These provide a `quick way to get started <http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/quick.html>`_.
