resolution_for_anat,The resolution to which anatomical images should be transformed during registration.,"1 An integer indicating three same dimensions (e.g., 1mm, 2mm, 3mm, 4mm);
2 A float number indicating three same dimensions (e.g., 3.5mm etc.); 3 Three numbers connected by 'x' indicating three different dimensions (e.g., 2.67mmx2.67mmx3mm etc.)"
template_brain_only_for_anat,Reference template for resampling during registration. Normally the default value (seen in the example YAML) is fine.,"A path (e.g., $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_${resolution_for_anat}_brain.nii.gz)."
template_skull_for_anat,Reference template for resampling during registration. Normally the default value (seen in the example YAML) is fine.,"A path (e.g., $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_${resolution_for_anat}_brain.nii.gz)."
regOption,Use either ANTS or FSL (FLIRT and FNIRT) as your anatomical registration method.,"A list containing ‘ANTS’, ‘FSL’, or both (e.g., [‘FSL’])."
fnirtConfig,Configuration file to be used by FSL to set FNIRT parameters.,"A template name (e.g., ‘T1_2_MNI152_2mm’)."
ref_mask,Configuration file to be used by FSL to set FNIRT parameters.,"A path (e.g., $FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_${resolution_for_anat}_brain_mask_dil.nii.gz)."
regWithSkull,Register skull-on anatomical image to a template.,"A list where ‘1’ represents ‘yes’ and ‘0’ represents ‘no’ (e.g., ‘[1]’)."
already_skullstripped,Disables skull-stripping on the anatomical inputs if they are already skull-stripped.,"A list where ‘1’ represents ‘yes’ and ‘0’ represents ‘no’ (e.g., ‘[1]’)."
ANTs_para_T1_registration,"Parameters setting for antsRegistration.The user can specify any number of 'stages' where a stage consists of a transform; an image metric; and iterations, shrink factors, and smoothing sigmas for each level. Note that explicitly setting the dimensionality, metric, transform, output, convergence, shrink-factors, and smoothing-sigmas parameters is mandatory.","See below for a full specification of parameters."
