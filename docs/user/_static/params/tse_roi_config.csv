runROITimeseries,Extract the average time series of one or more ROIs/seeds. Must be enabled for seed-based correlation analysis.,"A list where ‘1’ represents ‘yes’ and ‘0’ represents ‘no’ (e.g., ‘[1]’)."
tsa_roi_paths,"Enter full paths to region-of-interest (ROI) NIFTI files (.nii or .nii.gz) to be used for time-series extraction, and then select which types of analyses to run. Each line in this file should be the path to a NIfTI file containing a single mask. If you only wish to extract time series for newly defined spherical seed ROIs, set this field to None.", "'A path: type of analyses' or ‘None’. Available analyses: ['Avg', 'Voxel', 'SpatialReg']."
roiTSOutputs,"Extracted voxelwise time series are written as both a text file and a 1D file by default. With this option, you may also save them out as CSV files or Numpy arrays.","A two-element list, where the first element is a boolean (‘True’ or ‘False’) for whether or not to save out a CSV and the second element is a boolean for whether or not to save a Numpy array."
