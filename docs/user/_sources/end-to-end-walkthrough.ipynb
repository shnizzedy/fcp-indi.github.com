This guide is not a complete reference for all of the options available in C-PAC (for all documented options, consult [Running C-PAC](http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/running.html)); rather, this guide is a step-by-step tutorial for familiarizing oneself with the software.\n",

If you install Jupyter and bash_kernel on your own machine, you can [download this notebook](https://github.com/shnizzedy/fcp-indi.github.com/blob/source/docs/user/_sources/end-to-end-walkthrough.ipynb) and run the cells interactively. The outputs below the code cells are the actual outputs of the code in those cells.\n",
