Version v1.5.0 Beta - 2019.10.09
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**NEW FEATURES - GENERAL**

* **Phase-Encoding Polarity Distortion Correction (Blip-Up / Blip-Down).** A new option for distortion correction is available! Phase-Encoding Polarity (commonly known as blip-up/blip-down) employs phase-encoding direction-specific EPI field maps to correct for distortion in the direction of the phase-encoding.

* **N4 Bias Field Correction.** The ability to run N4 Bias Field Correction in the anatomical preprocessing pipeline has been added, via ANTs' N4BiasFieldCorrection.

* **Non-Local Means (NLM) filtering.** NLM has been integrated into the anatomical preprocessing pipeline, via ANTs DenoiseImage.

* **Increased Configurability of Output Resolution.** Users can now select write-out resolutions with a finer granularity of values, also allowing for native voxel dimension write-outs.

* **Increased Interpolation Configurability.** Introduced the ability to select a full range of interpolation options for transform application and resampling. LanczosWindowedSinc has been set as the new default for ANTs operations and Sinc for FSL operations.

* **PyPEER Integration.** C-PAC can now prepare your pipeline results directly for Predictive Eye Estimation. PEER is a previously developed support vector regression-based method for retrospectively estimating eye gaze from the fMRI signal in the eyeâ€™s orbit.

**NEW FEATURES - CROSS-PIPELINE REPRODUCIBILITY**

Several new preprocessing features have been added to C-PAC's pipeline choices, in an ongoing effort to incrementally expand C-PAC's configurability. These methods have been adapted from the niworkflows and fmriprep packages (see appropriate links below).

* **New BOLD Masking option.** A BOLD masking strategy designed by the fmriprep team is now available. The method employs both BET and 3dAutomask for refined BOLD masks. See the User Guide for more information.

* **ANTs Brain Extraction.** ANTs Brain extraction has now been integrated as an option for brain extraction. Implementation by the fmriprep team. See the User Guide for more information.

* **Increased Segmentation Configurability.** Thresholding options have returned, and new erosion options for anatomical segmentation have been introduced. The erosion implementation was adapted from fmriprep.

**IMPROVEMENTS**

* Added a selection of Neurodata's Neuroparc atlases to the C-PAC container, and C-PAC now also performs time-series extraction on these atlases by default (in addition to the original defaults).

* Improved parallelization for ISC and ISFC runs.

* Users can now employ the -monkey option for AFNI 3dSkullStrip for brain extraction, for non-human primate data.

**BUG FIXES**

* Fixed an issue where BIDS-format slice timing information was not being read into 3dTshift properly in some cases.

* Fixed an error preventing Seed-Based Correlation Analysis from running to completion.

* Fixed an error that would cause the pipeline to crash at the smoothing stage if the write-out resolution for functional preprocessed data and the resolution for functional-derived data were different.

* Fixed an issue that would prevent output files from being written to the output directory if nuisance regression was disabled.

* Fixed an issue where ISC and ISFC would not write out the results to the output directory.
