Version 0.3.1 Alpha - 2013.09.13
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. A range of improvements to the GUI and its operation.

#. Extended improvements to group analysis operation.

#. Error fix: custom FSL-FNIRT configuration files can now successfully be provided to CPAC.

#. Error fix: CPAC setup.py would not fully overwrite old files - setup.py now works correctly and also creates a backup folder with the old CPAC install directory.

#. Addition of some more informative and user-friendly error messages and user warnings.

#. CPAC pipeline configuration file renamed from config.yml to pipeline_config.yml.

#. Group analysis function update: the ability to classify EVs as either categorical or continuous has been temporarily removed as we continue our ongoing process of refining CPAC's group analysis model builder. The user must now provide a phenotypic file (.csv format) with categorical EVs broken out into dummy variables.
