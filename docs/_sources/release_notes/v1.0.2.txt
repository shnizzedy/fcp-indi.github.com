Version 1.0.2 Beta (Nov 5, 2017)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The updates to CPAC in this new version include:


* 
  CPAC now offers De-Spiking as an option in nuisance regression, which regresses out the impact of motion-induced artifacts from the functional timeseries from volumes exhibiting motion greater than a specified threshold, without removing those volumes.

* 
  Users can now select which Framewise Displacement (FD) calculation to use (Jenkinson's or Power's) when applying the motion threshold for either Scrubbing or De-Spiking.

* 
  CPAC can now automatically select a Framewise Displacement (FD) threshold based on a percentage value provided in the pipeline configuration. For example, if provided 5%, CPAC will select a cut-off derived from the top 5% of highest-motion volumes. See the `User Guide <http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/nuisance.html#configuring-nuisance-signal-regression-options>`_ for more information.

* 
  Scrubbing has been moved to the Nuisance Regression tab in the GUI's pipeline configuration editor. The pipeline configuration YAML keys have changed for scrubbing settings. See the `User Guide Nuisance Regression page <http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/nuisance.html#configuration-without-the-gui>`_ and the `sample pipeline configuration file <https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/blob/master/configs/pipeline_config.yml#L335>`_ for more details.

* 
  Re-introduced the ability to stop pipeline runs easily from the GUI.

* 
  Fixed a bug in the data configuration (subject list) builder that would cause non-NIfTI files to be included if the user did not explicitly define the file extension in the file template.

* 
  Fixed a bug in the data configuration (subject list) builder where some fields would not get populated when re-loading the settings in the GUI.

* 
  Added better error-catching and messages in nuisance regression which warn the user if nuisance parameters are too stringent for the regression to complete properly.
