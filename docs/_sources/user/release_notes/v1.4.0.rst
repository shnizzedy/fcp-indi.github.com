Version 1.4.0 Beta - 2019.02.04
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Ease of Use**

* **Quick Start Guide.** By pulling our Docker or Singularity container, you can kick off C-PAC with your dataset in minutes, without any prior package or library installations other than Docker or Singularity. More info available on our :doc:`User Guide </quick>`.

**New Features**

* **TURNKEY MODE.** For users who prefer not to make decisions regarding their pipeline, C-PAC now includes a pre-configured default pipeline that includes the most commonly used decisions. The pre-configured pipeline selections are described in the :doc:`Quick-start guide </quick>` under "Running Turnkey Mode".

* **Nonparametric Permutation Inference.** FMRIB's FSL Randomise has been integrated into C-PAC's suite of group-level analyses. You can use the already-existing FSL group-level presets or the group model builder to specify your model.

**Improvements**

* **Early Access to the new C-PAC GUI.** The first part of C-PAC's new graphical user interface (GUI) for generating and editing custom pipelines is available! All are encouraged to take a quick test-drive of the pipeline builder and let us know your thoughts. All feedback welcome on our `forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cpax_forum>`__.

* **Group Model-Building Modularity.** As part of an ongoing process of improving usability, C-PAC's group-level analysis model builder now offers more control over your model design. It is now easier to review changes to your design matrix before specifying contrasts.

**Error Fixes**

* An error preventing users from running only anatomical preprocessing has been fixed.

* An error in the Unpaired Two-Group Difference preset of the FSL Group Model Presets, which was causing certain covariate labels to occasionally be formatted improperly, has been fixed.

**Coming Soon (Release 1.5 early 2019)**

* More denoising options
* Quasi-periodic pattern (QPP) identification
* New Graphical User Interface (GUI) Upgrade
* Further modularity & usability improvements
