Version 0.3.5 Alpha - 2014.09.22
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. Upgraded to the newer version of ANTS for anatomical and functional registration, introducing the new tools available and making the installation process more straightforward.

#. New group analysis model builder:
    - New user-friendly GUI for setting up your group-level analysis model, with an easier interface for configuring your EVs.
    - Design matrices are now generated using the Patsy software package; you can specify your model with a design formula.
    - The ability to include the mean of your output as a regressor has been introduced (mean regression).
    - New interface for specifying contrasts using simple operators (EV1a > EV1b, etc.).
    - Users can now specify a separate output directory for group analysis, so several runs can be completed without having to move previous group-level analysis runs into backup folders.

#. Improved memory usage during network centrality with sparsity thresholding.

#. Allowed users to provide their own lateral ventricles mask for CSF nuisance regression and corrected a source of inflexibility regarding how CPAC extracts signal from the ventricles.

#. Resolved an issue where functional images and derivatives would be written into a resolution other than what the user specified, an issue where f/ALFF outputs would be written into data types more space-consuming than necessary, an issue with an incorrect registration in nuisance correction, and assorted other bug fixes and improved error messages.

#. Several GUI improvements to user-friendliness in the pipeline configuration editor.
