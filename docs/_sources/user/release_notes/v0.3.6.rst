Version 0.3.6 Alpha - 2014.10.08
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. Including EV interactions in group analysis model design is now possible in the CPAC group analysis model builder. Refer to the Patsy documentation for more information on interactions and how to encode them: https://patsy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/formulas.html#the-formula-language

#. Introduced the option to run ANTS anatomical registration using an input image with the skull on.

#. Users can now provide CPAC with input anatomical images that have already been skull-stripped.

#. More flexible slice-timing correction configuration.

#. z-score standardization and Fisher z-score standardization now take place after registration to template and smoothing, and naming conventions for z-score standardized outputs in the output directory are now more clear.

#. Dual regression now also outputs anatomically registered and smoothed outputs as files in addition to the regular "stack" (one file with each map included as a volume).

#. Assorted improvements to error messages and reporting.
