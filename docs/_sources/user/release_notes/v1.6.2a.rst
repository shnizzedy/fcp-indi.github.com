**Error Fixes**


* 
  Brain extraction in Singularity container: an error in the Singularity container with running AFNI 3dSkullStrip in the C-PAC pipeline (RuntimeError: Xvfb did not start) has been resolved. (https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/541, https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1277)

* 
  Censoring during nuisance regression: an error where a pipeline crash would result when the motion threshold was too high and no frames were marked for censoring has been resolved. (https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1256)

* 
  C-PAC Warm Restart: an error that would result when running C-PAC a second time with the same working directory (_csv.Error) has been resolved. (https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1300, https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/pull/1302)

In addition, the C-PAC Docker and Singularity images, as well as the AWS AMI, have all been updated. These provide a `quick way to get started <http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/quick.html>`_.
