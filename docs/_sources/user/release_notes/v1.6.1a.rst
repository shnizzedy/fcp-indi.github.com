Version 1.6.1a Beta (Mar 6, 2020)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**FIXES**


* 
  A hotfix has been made to correct an issue where a refined/processed version of the white matter segmentation mask was being sent to boundary-based functional-to-anatomical coregistration, instead of the raw white matter mask as intended.

* 
  An issue where group-level analyses weren't pulling the required input data from the output directories of individual-level preprocessing runs has been fixed.

In addition, the C-PAC Docker and Singularity images, as well as the AWS AMI, have all been updated. These provide a `quick way to get started <http://fcp-indi.github.io/docs/user/quick.html>`_.
