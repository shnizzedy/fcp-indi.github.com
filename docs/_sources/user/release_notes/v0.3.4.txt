Version 0.3.4 Alpha - 2014.04.08
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. Added local Functional Connectivity Density (lFCD) measure to the Network Centrality options.

#. Added the ability to specify different centrality parameters for each of the measures (degree, eigenvector, lFCD).

#. Group-level analysis is now able to be run in parallel - simply set the amount of processors you wish to dedicate in the Group

#. Analysis tab in the pipeline editor window under 'Number of Models to Run Simultaneously'.

#. The processing run timing feature is now more polished- look for a cpac_individual_timing_{pipeline name}.csv or cpac_group_timing_{pipeline name}.csv file in your output directory for a breakdown and comparison of information and run times from separate runs.

#. Introduced the option to turn on/off Z-score standardization of outputs - this can be found within the 'Derivatives Settings' tab in the pipeline editor.

#. GUI fixes and improvements, including errors involving naming the pipeline yaml file and the removal of redundant options.

#. Group level analysis models no longer overwrite each other within the working directory - all subcategories, ROIs, etc. retain their intermediary files for re-runs.

#. The 'Test Configuration' feature in the pipeline editor is now more robust.

#. ANTS anatomical registration no longer takes up more processors than has been assigned by the user.

#. Speed improvements for centrality functions, including new C-based code.

#. Setting the memory limit for centrality will now work appropriately. Number of voxels to compute connectivity maps for at once will be set to be equal to the memory limit.

#. Improved unit testing for dual regression, TSE and SCA

#. TSE can now handle masks and ROIs with floating point values

#. Pipeline config files with a leading number in their CPAC pipeline name will now load into the GUI properly


Instructions for Updating to 0.3.4
