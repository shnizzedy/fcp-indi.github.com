Visual Data Quality Control Interface
=====================================

C-PAC's data quality control (QC) interface allows you to take a quick glance at the overall quality of your results (registration quality, signal-to-noise ratio, movement plots, computed derivative histograms, etc.). In its current form, the QC interface is a collection of HTML pages - one for each participant-scan-nuisance regression strategy combination, and they can be found in the Output Directory under each participant's directory level.

Upcoming Additions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In future releases, more visualizations will be introduced, and the QC pages will be integrated into an easy-to-use dashboard that is updated throughout the process of your C-PAC run, and also provides information on the status of the pipeline. As always, we greatly appreciate any ideas, suggestions, or items on your wishlist and `take them into consideration <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cpax_forum>`_.
